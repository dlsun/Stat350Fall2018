    "\n",
    "- 1 point for your answer (You must show work and/or explain your reasoning to earn credit.)\n",
    "- 1 point for writing a simulation using Symbulate checking your answer. (Designing an appropriate simulation is challenging! You will have to think hard about the problem for many of these.)\n",
    "- 1 point for your reflection (I want you to reflect on what you learned from the problem---or, if the problem was straightforward for you, what you think I was trying to teach you.)\n",
