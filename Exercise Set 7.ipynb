    "- 1 point for your answer (You must show work and/or explain your reasoning to earn credit.)\n",
    "- 1 point for writing a simulation using Symbulate checking your answer. (Designing an appropriate simulation is challenging! You will have to think hard about the problem for many of these.)\n",
    "- 1 point for your reflection (I want you to reflect on what you learned from the problem---or, if the problem was straightforward for you, what you think I was trying to teach you.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 5 is purely coding and is designed to make you comfortable with practical digital signal processing. For Question 5, you will earn:\n",

    "- 2 points for your code.\n",
    "- 1 point for your reflection.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can type your solution, simulation code, and reflection directly in this notebook (using LaTeX for mathematical notation). You can also prepare your solution and reflection on a separate piece of paper and attach your simulations for all 5 questions at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that you will have to upload your solution in the form of a PDF, so it may be worth the investment to learn how to typeset math."
